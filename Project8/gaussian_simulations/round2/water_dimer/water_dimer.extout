 AIMExt is a component of the AIMAll package ( http://aim.tkgristmill.com )

 TP:  64-bit Mac OS X

 AIMExt is a heavily modified and extended version of the EXTREME program
 developed by members of R.F.W. Bader's research group

 Much of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is described in the book:
   "Atoms in Molecules - A Quantum Theory"
   R.F.W. Bader, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990
